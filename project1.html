     <p> I. Web pages are composed with HTML. Understanding the basic syntax of HTML is needed to make a web page. </p> 
     <p> II. Using <b>tags</b>, we can <em>insert images/links</em> and <em>change plain text into bold or italic</em>. </p>
     <p> III. The set of opening tag, content and closing tag is called an <b><em>"element"</em></b>. There are <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b> elements. The block elements makes <em>invisible boxes</em> <small>while inline don't</small>. </p> 
     <p> IV. We can add style by using CSS. And the whole HTML document has a structure, <small>which we would be learning in future lectures.</small> </p>

       <li> HTML - structure </li>

     <h3 class="description-title"> II. Structure of HTML </h3> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <b>DOCTYPE html</b> on the first line declared that the document is a HTML document </li>
       <li> Some tags are used to describe the structure: <em> html, head, title, body, h1 (heading), p (paragraph) </em> </li> 
       <li> We <b>indent</b> while writing codes to make the structure of HTML easily visible: tree structure - able to expand or collapse, encapsuled  </li>
      </ul>

     <h3 class="description-title"> III. Web page are made up by boxes </h3> 
      <ul> 
       <li> Add description of boxes by namming the class </li>

      <h3 class="description-title"> IV. Computer program needs to be structured. </h3>
       <p>
        That means there are some rules when writing codes. The computer reads the lines from the top to the bottom. So the logical flow of the code have to be aligned in the same direction. The code's have to be divided into meaningful components. And we need to minimize repeating same lines. If we know the structure, we can predict the organization of code's content. Well structured programs are easily read and understood.
       </p>
       <p> There are several benefits of avoiding repetition. First, we can minimize the total length of the code. Therefore, there are less to write, less risks of making errors and less to read. Second, it makes future changes easier and simple by putting same components together. If we have written the same codes several times, we should have find where the same parts are and change all of them one after one. </p>

       <li> We can define the content, padding, border and margin. </li>
       <li> By using "box-sizing:border-box;", the size includes the border and padding (not the margin). </li>
